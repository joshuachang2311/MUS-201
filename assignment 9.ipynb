First of all is that, every diagonal from bottom right to top left, the numerator is always the same number or its double (when the denominator is greater than that number). The numerators from left to right are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 respectively. The absence of 13 is because this is a diamond with n = 11, and that 13 is a prime number.\n",
